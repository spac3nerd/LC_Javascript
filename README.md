# LC_Javascript
My solutions to LC problems 

# Running the solutions
You may use IntelliJ Idea or Webstorm for simplicty - There are two sets of run configurations set up, 
one which kicks off an alias in package.json, and one which invoked nodejs directly. 

# Structure
For each problem, there is a JS file which contains one or more functions which run the solution. There is a function called "runTest()", which kicks off whichever solution function you wish to run/debug. Very simple!
